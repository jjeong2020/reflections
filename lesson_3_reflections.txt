When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collaborating with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it automatically pulled changes, the changes could be unfinished or you might need more changes to finish the new addition to the code, so it can be confusing.
