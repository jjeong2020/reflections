When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collaborating with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it automatically pulled changes, the changes could be unfinished or you might need more changes to finish the new addition to the code, so it can be confusing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks allow you to make a copy of somebody else's repository directly on the GitHub servers without pulling down the code to your local machine first. Branches happen on a single repository. Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You have local access to the most updated state of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would probably work on the same device rather than being able to remotely access each other's work from different locations.
